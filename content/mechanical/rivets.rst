Rivets
======

Rivets are metal pins that come from the factory with a head on one end. Rivets
are commonly found in aircraft, ship, and bridge construction. Rivets are
commonly used in laboratory apparatus to make permanent joints between
structural members or secure sheet metal to a frame. They are inserted through a
hole in the two parts to be joined, and then the pin end is deformed or "bucked"
until it forms a second head that permanently secures the fastener and parts.
Rivets are best suited for shear load bearing applications and are fast and
economical to install.

A variety of rivets called pop or blind rivets can be used when only one side of
the joint is accessible. They are hollow tube-type rivets with a shank running
through their core. A special tool (air, electric, or hand) pulls on the shank
after the rivet is inserted into the hole and deforms the back side of the
rivet. The shank is then broken off and the joint is fast. Rivets can be easily
removed by drilling off the head and punching the core out.
