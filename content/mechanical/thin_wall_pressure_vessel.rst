Thin Walled Pressure Vessels
============================

A thin walled pressure vessel is generally considered to be one whose walls
are less than about 1/10 or 1/20 of the radius of the vessel. The formulas
provided below are for reference and calculation, but before constructing a
real pressure vessel you should check with an engineer. The information is
provided for your reference. Remember that a catastrophic failure of a vessel
could result in serious injury or death.

Longitudinal Stress
------------
:math:`\sigma_l = \frac{p d}{4 t}`

Circumferential (Hoop) Stress
-----------------------------
:math:`\sigma_h = \frac{p d}{2 t}`

Nomenclature
------------
* :math:`\sigma_h` = Hoop Stress
* :math:`\sigma_l` = Longitudinal Stress
* :math:`p` = Internal pressure
* :math:`d` = Internal diameter of the tube
* :math:`t` = Wall thickness
