**Offices:** Deike 536, 439

**E-mail:** marone@psu.edu, jleeman@psu.edu

Course Description
------------------
Hands-on introduction to the principles of measurement, control and experimental
design.  Digital formats and representation, file structure, practical aspects
of sensors. Introduction to transducers and digital representation of analog
measurement.  Design of reliable and effective measurements of physical
variables including force, displacement, temperature, stress and strain.  Analog
to digital conversion, real-time data display, practical introduction to analog
electronics including buffers and differential amplifiers, offsets and voltage
dividers.  Transducer calibration, instrument testing, and documentation.
Basics of mechanical design for laboratory and field-based hardware, including
communication with machine shops.  Introduction to 3D printing and practical
experience with 3D printers at Penn State.

Much of our work will be based on the Arduino platform via the
`Sparkfun Inventors Kit <https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12060>`_ .
Hands on classroom activities and class projects will use this kit.  Students
will develop approaches for signal measurement, experiment control, and data
logging.  A course research project will be completed with the inventor’s kit.

Course Goals
------------
#. To learn how to design and build basic mechanical and electrical devices for laboratory measurement work.
#. Gain hands-on experience using real equipment, sensors, and machines.

Course Materials
----------------
**Text:** We will be providing excerpts from a variety of texts. See the course
website for a list of useful reference and learning materials.

**Other Supplies:** `SparkFun Inventors Kit <https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12060>`_ , Laptop

Laboratory Expectations
-----------------------
Each student is required to do his or her own lab.  Discussion of the lab
concepts amongst your classmates is encouraged.  Late lab reports will not be
accepted unless there are extenuating circumstances that have been brought to
our attention and cleared prior to the deadline.  If extenuating circumstances
arise and have been cleared, the lab must be made up within a week of the missed
class period.

Attendance
----------
To learn from the lectures and activities you must be present. Attendance will
count towards the class participation portion of the final grade.

If you need to miss class due to athletic or religious reasons please inform us
as soon as possible, but by no later than one week prior to the missed class.
We understand that sometimes you will need to miss a class due to illness or
unavoidable circumstances (ex. a death in the family) and will not be able to
provide the required one-week notice. Please let us know as soon as possible and
arrangements can be made.

Course Website
--------------
We will be using Canvas for posting grades and copyright class material (book
chapter scans, etc.). The course material, topic summaries, labs, and other
information is on the
`course website <http://tge.geoscience.tech/>`_ .
Please check it regularly for announcements and to explore the embedded videos
and content. Video recordings of the lecture will also be posted.

Accommodation of Students with Disabilities
-------------------------------------------
The `Office of Disability Services <http://equity.psu.edu/ods/>`_ requests and
maintains disability-related documents; certifies eligibility for services;
determines academic adjustments, auxiliary aids, and/or services; and develops
plans for the provision of academic adjustments, auxiliary aids, and/or services
as mandated under Title II of the ADA Amendments Act (ADAAA) of 2008 and Section
504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.  A
`list of these services is provided <http://equity.psu.edu/ods/student-information>`_ .

Academic Misconduct
-------------------
Cheating will not be tolerated under any circumstances. Cheating is unfair to
your classmates and is an insult to curiosity and intellectual inquiry. In the
context of this class, cheating includes using a clicker for another person,
copying from another student’s exam or assignments, plagiarism, and other
activities. Students caught cheating will be reported to University officials
and receive an automatic failing grade on the activity. General guidelines are
covered here and in the Senate Policy 49-20 on Academic Integrity. This course
follows the guidelines set out for the College of Earth and Mineral Sciences for
offenses and appropriate punishments --please
`read these <http://www.ems.psu.edu/current_undergrad_students/academics/integrity_policy>`_ .

Plagiarism is cheating. This includes cutting and pasting material from sources
on the web. All work and wording of assignments should be your own. Limited
quotation of sources is acceptable and should be referenced accordingly. All
written work will be subject to electronic plagiarism checking with
`Turn It In <http://www.turnitin.com/>`_ . Submitted computer code and other
products will be automatically compared to ensure that two submissions are not
the same.
