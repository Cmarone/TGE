Lecture 23 - Signal Integrity and Input Impedance
=================================================

**Date:** 11/8/16

Summary
-------
Any time we amplify, process, or digitize an electrical signal there will be
noise. One of the greatest challenge in research equipment is making sure that
the signals remain as pristine and low noise as possible. In this class we will
discuss how to keep your signals clean as well as how input impedance works.
