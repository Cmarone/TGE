Lectures 24/25 - Projects
=========================

**Date:** 11/10/16, 11/15/16

Summary
-------
There are no classes for the Thanksgiving holiday. Use this time to work on your
semester projects. It is only about 2.5 weeks until the final project
presentations! Make sure you are including the time required to have any parts
3D printed, machined, etc. The end of the semester is a busy time for the shops,
so plan ahead!
