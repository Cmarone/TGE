Lecture 8 - Microcontrollers and Design Patterns
================================================

**Date:** 9/15/16

Summary
-------
There are many types of microcontrollers and peripherals. In this lecture we go
over the basics of microcontroller interfaces and commonly found
microcontrollers. We also discuss the software design patterns commonly found in
software/firmware design.

Class Plan
----------
* Go over each of the commonly found peripherals on a microcontroller (namely the Arduino the students have) such as I2C, SPI, PWM, and UART.
* Discuss what an interrupt is and why you shouldnâ€™t use them.
* Discuss system timers.
* Show what a function is and why we encapsulate and decouple code.
* Show common software architectures (polling, state machine, interrupt driven, producer-consumer)

Activity
--------
Complete the :ref:`state_machine_XRD` activity.

Assignment
----------
Complete the :ref:`arduino_stoplight` activity.
Email us your completed code. **Due 9/27/16**

Materials
---------
Lecture slides and video will be posted here after the lecture is given.
