**Introduction to the principles of experimental design, measurement,
and control.**

Content
-------
Hands-on introduction to the principles of measurement, control and experimental
design.  Digital formats and representation, file structure, practical aspects
of sensors. Introduction to transducers and digital representation of analog
measurement.  Design of reliable and effective measurements of physical
variables including force, displacement, temperature, stress and strain.  Analog
to digital conversion, real-time data display, practical introduction to analog
electronics including buffers and differential amplifiers, offsets and voltage
dividers.  Transducer calibration, instrument testing, and documentation.
Basics of mechanical design for laboratory and field-based hardware, including
communication with machine shops.  Introduction to 3D printing and practical
experience with 3D printers at Penn State.

Much of our work will be based on the Arduino platform via the
`Sparkfun Inventors Kit <https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12060>`_ .
Hands on classroom activities and class projects will use this kit.  Students
will develop approaches for signal measurement, experiment control, and data
logging.  A course research project will be completed with the inventor’s kit.
