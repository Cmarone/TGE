**Introduction to the principles of experimental design, measurement,
and control.**

Content
-------
No matter what you do in geology or geophysics, you will need to measure
something. Measurement is a complex problem with many instrument effects,
environmental biases, and complex system-level interactions. In this course
students will learn the principles of experimental design and the practical
aspects of using sensors to make reliable and effective measurements of
extrinsic physical variables, including force, displacement, temperature, stress
and strain. After learning basic measurement and signal theory, we will cover
transducers and their calibration, simple concepts in analog electronics,
instrument testing, and documentation. Much of our work will be based on the
Arduino platform, with additional exposure to other open-source platforms such
as Beagle Bone. Students will develop Arduino approaches for signal measurement
and experiment control, and ultimately conduct a basic research project in which
they design a system to collect measurements in the lab or field. We will also
cover aspects of mechanical design and how to communicate your design to the
machine shop, 3D printer, or other manufacturing service.
