Lecture 13 - Sealing

-------
In almost every apparatus we are trying to keep different media separate. This
could be sealing oil inside a hydraulic piston, sealing air inside a pressure
vessel, or sealing in a vacuum chamber. In this class we will cover the most
common sealing techniques used in laboratory equipment and how to safely
implement them.
