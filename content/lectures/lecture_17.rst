Lecture 17 - Transducers and Calibration
========================================

**Date:** 10/18/16

Summary
-------
Transducers are how we can turn physical quantities into mechanical and
electrical signals that we can more easily measure. In this class we will go
over transducers to measure temperature, force, displacement, pressure, and
more. We will also discuss how to calibrate transducers to give accurate and
reliable readings.
