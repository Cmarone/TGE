Lecture 17 - Transducers
========================

**Date:** 10/18/16

Summary
-------
Transducers are how we can turn physical quantities into mechanical and
electrical signals that we can more easily measure. In this class we will go
over transducers to measure temperature, force, displacement, pressure, and
more.

Class Plan
----------
* Discuss the role of a transducer
* Show the difference between analog and digital transducers
* Discuss thermistors, thermocouples, and RTDs for temperature measurement
* Discuss DCDTs, LVDTs, and other displacement transducers
* Discuss strain gauges for force/strain measurement
* Discuss pressure transducers

Activity
--------
Complete the :ref:`thermistor_calculation`. **Due 10/20/16**

Assignment
----------
Find an object that you will instrument for the strain gauge activity. This
could be a piece of rock, a coffee mug, or anything else you can think you.
Remember that you must be able to mount the strain gauges to it, so a smooth
surface is necessary. **Due: 10/25/16**
