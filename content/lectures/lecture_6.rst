Lecture 6 - Electronics Prototyping
===================================

**Date:** 9/8/16

Summary
-------
In an effort to introduce students to a broad range of tools available for their
projects, we will spend several lectures on digital and electronics topics
before returning to mechanical design. This section is designed to be hands on
as much as possible with the theory of electronics coming later when students
can see how it will be applied. Prototyping electronics uses a wide variety of
tools and construction techniques. In the class we will go over the prototyping
techniques commonly used on the bench and in the lab.

Class Plan
----------
* Talk about the various levels of permanence of prototypes (development, semi-permanent, permanent, production)
* Show breadboard and jumper construction technique
* Examples of Perfboard and point-to-point wiring (including strip/bus board)
* Show wire-wrap construction examples
* Talk about Copper board construction (skywire, deadbug, Manhattan)
* Show a custom PCB
* Cover basic soldering equuipment and techniques

Activity
--------
Using the breadboard and components in the inventorâ€™s kit, replicate the blink
exercise using an external LED on a different digital output pin by following
the :ref:`blinky_2.0` activity.

Assignment
----------
Complete the :ref:`project_proposal` assignment. Think of this as writing the
assignment for your final project. The idea and features must be settled now for
you to be able to plan and complete the project on time. **Due 9/13/16**
