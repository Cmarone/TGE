Lecture 10 - Mechanical Drawing
===============================

**Date:** 9/22/16

Summary
-------
We are going to switch gears back to mechanical design for about 2.5 weeks so
students will have those skills for their projects. In this class we will show
the principles of mechanical drawing so that you can communicate your part
design to the machine shop or manufacturer. Good mechanical drawing makes the
difference between you getting what you thought you designed and getting
something totally different back from the shop.
