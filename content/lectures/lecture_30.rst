Lecture 30 - Hydraulics/Pneumatics
==================================

**Date:** 12/1/16

Summary
-------
Many pieces of laboratory apparatus use a hydraulic or pneumatic system to
manipulate samples, apply load, or move parts of the machine. In this class we
will introduce the basics of these systems including their mechanical advantage,
operating principles, and hazards/maintenance.

Class Plan
----------
* Why use hydraulics and pneumatic systems?
* Mechanical advantage
* Parts of a pneumatic system
* Parts of a hydraulic system
* Design considerations

Activity
--------
Complete the calculating hydraulic force activity. **Due at the end of class**

Media
-----
Lecture slides and video will be posted here after the lecture is given.
