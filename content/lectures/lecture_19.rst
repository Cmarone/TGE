Lecture 19 - Strain Gauges
==========================

**Date:** 10/25/16

Summary
-------
Last class we discussed transducers and calibration. This period we will build a
strain gauge bridge to measure deformation of an object. This project will be
built upon for the next several labs.

Class Plan
----------
Complete the strain gauge activity during the class period using the facilities
in the lab.

Assignment
----------
Complete the :ref:`strain_gage_activity`. Show us your strain gauged object working
when hooked up to a multimeter. **Due: 10/27/16**
