Lecture 11 - CAD and 3D Printing
================================

**Date:** 9/27/16

Summary
-------
Modern design often utilizes 3D CAD tools to help design assemblies with minimal
unforeseen issues. In this lecture we will demonstrate the basic principles of
3D sketching/modeling and how to rapidly prototype those 3D designs with a 3D
printer.

Class Plan
----------
* Introduce the concept of sketches, extrusions, revolutions, and design intent
* Introduce the various forms of 3D printing and rapid prototyping (FDM, SLA, Laser Cutting, CNC machining)

Activity
--------
Create a simple part or modify an existing part using the CAD platform of your
choice (we recommend `OnShape <https://www.onshape.com>`_ ). Instructions are in
the simple part design activity.

Assignment
----------
Using the part you created in class, or another part, complete the
:ref:`3D_print_activity`. **Due 10/13/16**
