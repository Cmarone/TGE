the semester project. Examples of ideas for semester projects will be shown to
help generate ideas for each student’s project.

Class Plan
----------
* Instructor introductions
* Go over course syllabus
* Introduce the idea of a semester long course project
* Show example projects
* Go over the Arduino hardware and the contents of the inventor’s kit.

Activity
--------
Have students setup their Arduino environment and complete the :ref:`blinky_1.0`
activity. Read the details about the Arduino on the :ref:`arduino_setup` page.

Assignment
----------
Complete the :ref:`project_brainstorm` activity. You should have 5 ideas for a

Instructor Notes
----------------
It is helpful to bring a Phillips screwdriver and set of diagonal cutters. The
screwdriver is useful for helping students attach the Arduino to the base plate
and the cutters are used to remove the zip-tie around the included jumper
wires in the kit.
