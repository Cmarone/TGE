Lecture 15 - Electronics Components and Schematics
==================================================

**Date:** 10/11/16

Summary
-------
A basic understanding of electronics is essential to work in the modern
scientific lab. In this class we will cover the basic components: the resistor,
inductor, capacitor, transistor, and diode. Students will also learn how to
recognize components on a schematic diagram and read the connections between
them.

Class Plan
----------
* Introduce the basic concept of electricity
* Differentiate between conventional and electron current flow
* Introduce Ohm's Law
* Introduce Kirchhoff's Laws
* Show common schematic symbols and notation
* Discuss the resistor and it's properties
* Discuss the capacitor and it's properties
* Discuss the inductor and it's properties
* Discuss the diode and it's properties
* Discuss the transistor and it's properties

Activity
--------
There are several in-class exercises included in the slides that students will
perform to provide a formative assessment during the lecture.

Assignment
----------
Pair up with someone and build a copy of the :ref:`arduino_voltmeter` to use
in completing the lab for Thursday. **Due: 10/13/16**
