Lecture 20 - Amplifiers : Part 1
================================

**Date:** 10/27/16

Summary
-------
Many of the signals we want to measure when doing research are very small and
need to be amplified. The most common tool in the engineerâ€™s tool belt is the
operational amplifier. In this class we will introduce the ideal operational
amplifier and show how to use it as a buffer, amplifier, and comparator.
