Lecture 20 - Amplifiers : Part 1
================================

**Date:** 10/27/16

Summary
-------
Many of the signals we want to measure when doing research are very small and
need to be amplified. The most common tool in the engineerâ€™s tool belt is the
operational amplifier. In this class we will introduce the ideal operational
amplifier and show how to use it as a buffer, amplifier, and comparator.

Class Plan
----------
* Discuss the need for amplifiers in the laboratory
* Introduce the ideal amplifier
* Introduce the concepts of gain and open-loop gain
* Show a voltage follower (buffer) circuit
* Comparator
* Inverting amplifier
* Non-inverting amplifier
* Differential amplifier

Activity
--------
Complete the included formative assessments during the lecture.

Assignment
----------
Complete the designing a differential amplifier activity. **Due: 11/1/16**
