Lecture 14 - Pressure Vessel Design
===================================

**Date:** 10/6/16

Summary
-------
Pressure vessels are used to subject samples to in-situ conditions, to allow
processes to happen in a vacuum, and to safely store/transfer energy. In this
class we will discuss the safe operation of pressure vessels and how to design a
pressure vessel that both withstands the required operating conditions and is
not excessively over-engineered and wasteful of material.
