Lecture 26 - Control Systems/Loops
==================================

**Date:** 11/17/16

Summary
-------
We often need our apparatus to maintain some set of conditions. It could be
controlling the temperature, pressure, humidity, of speed of some process.
Taking a noisy real world signal and controlling an apparatus is a complex
process. We will introduce the elements of PID control and show practical
examples of control loops.

Class Plan
----------
* Why do we need control systems
* Open-loop vs. Closed-loop control
* Logic control
* On-Off control
* Linear control
* Proportional control
* PID control

Activity
--------
Complete the On-Off control activity. **Due: 11/29/16**

Media
-----
Lecture slides and video will be posted here after the lecture is given.
