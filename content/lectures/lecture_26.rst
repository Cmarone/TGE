Lecture 26 - ADC/DAC
====================

**Date:** 11/17/16

Summary
-------
We have already talked about the digital representation of voltage and even used
an analog-to-digital converter to measure voltages with the Arduino. In this
class we’re going to dive into how analog-to-digital converters work and the
advantages of different converter architectures. We will also introduce
digital-to-analog conversion – generating a voltage from a digital
representation.

Class Plan
----------
* What is ADC and DAC?
* Charging a capacitor as an ADC
* Resistor divider/comparator example of ADC
* Flash ADC
* Successive approximation ADC
* Multi-slope ADC
* Sigma-Delta ADC
* PWM DAC
* R2R DAC

Activity
--------
Complete the Arduino ADC activity. **Due: 11/22/16**

Media
