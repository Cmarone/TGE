Lecture 12 - Principles of Mechanical Design
============================================

**Date:** 9/29/16

Summary
-------
Just like there are common software design patterns, there are best practices
and tested solutions to many mechanical design problems. In this class we will
cover some of the most common mechanical design principles and tools. With these
tools you should have a good start on designing complex and useful parts and
assemblies.

Class Plan
----------
* Introduce degrees of freedom of a system
* Demonstrate basic techniques on kinematic design
* Show journal, rolling element, and linear bearings
* Introduce the concept of pre-loading
* Show torsion, tension, and compression springs
* Introduce flexures
* Show gears, chains, and belts and power transmission methods
* Discuss common materials used in laboratory and prototype fabrication

Activity
--------
Look around online for materials and resources you will need for your project.
Begin making a list of them to submit to us to order. Sign yourself up for
catalogs from major suppliers.
