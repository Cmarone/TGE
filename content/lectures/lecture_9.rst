Lecture 9 - Digital Logic and Representation
============================================

**Date:** 9/20/16

Summary
-------
We have shown that almost all scientific data collection ends with a signal
being digitized, operated on, and stored. In this class we will cover how data
is represented digitally and basic digital logic operations. The lecture
concludes with a summary of how to most efficiently store data.

Class Plan
----------
* Show simple digital logic operations - AND, OR, XOR, NOR. (Do in class activity)
* Discuss representation of numbers/text as digital values with ASCII, Hex, Binary, and floating point representations. (Do in class activity)
* Show and discuss the merits of different file formats that data can be stored in (plain text, HDF5, TDMS, and other proprietary formats).

Activity
--------
In groups, complete the digital logic operations activity.

Assignment
----------
Complete the digital representation homework activity. **Due 9/27/16**


Materials
---------
Lecture slides and video will be posted here after the lecture is given.
