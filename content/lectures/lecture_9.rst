Lecture 9 - Digital Logic and Representation
============================================

**Date:** 9/20/16

Summary
-------
We have shown that almost all scientific data collection ends with a signal
being digitized, operated on, and stored. In this class we will cover how data
is represented digitally and basic digital logic operations.

Class Plan
----------
* Show simple digital logic operations - AND, OR, XOR, NOR. (Do in class activity)
* Discuss representation of numbers/text as digital values with ASCII, Hex,
  Binary, and floating point representations.

Activity
--------
In class, complete the :ref:`digital_logic_operations` activity.

Assignment
----------
Complete the :ref:`digital_representation` homework activity. **Due 9/27/16**
