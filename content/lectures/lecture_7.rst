Lecture 7 - Data Acquisition
============================

**Date:** 9/13/16

Summary
-------
In this lecture we will introduce principles of data acquisition, because to do
science we need to collect data from our machines!

Class Plan
----------
* Introduce the DAQ flow (physical system, transducer, signal conditioning, A2D, and computer)
* Give a high level overview of each block of the system
* Show common gotcha cases for data acquisition (aliasing, signal integrity, system loading)
* Show common systems used for DAQ (LabView/NI, LabJack, DATAQ, Omega, GDS)

Activity
--------
Using your inventorâ€™s kit complete the :ref:`flex_data_acquisition` activity.

Assignment
----------
Complete the ref:`flex_data_acquisition` activity if you did not during class.
Email us a plot (from the Arduino IDE, or one that you made) of your flex sensor
flexing. **Due 9/15/16**


Materials
---------
Lecture slides and video will be posted here after the lecture is given.
