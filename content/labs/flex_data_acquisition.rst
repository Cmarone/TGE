Flex Sensor Data Acquisition
============================

In this activity you will learn how to take a transducer, create a basic
signal conditioning circuit, then record data from that system. We will be using
the flex sensor from the Inventor's Kit and measure how far you have bent the
sensor over time. This could represent the bending of a structure in the wind
or the deformation of a system in laboratory.

Materials
---------
* Arduino UNO
* USB Cable
* Breadboard
* M/M Jumper wires
* Computer (Mac, Linux, Windows)

Procedure
---------

Deliverables
------------
Turn in a plot of the bend of your sensor over time as you manipulate it. This
can be a plot from the Arduino IDE or one you make in your favorite graphing
software.
