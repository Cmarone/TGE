The course project should help you solve a research problem you are facing while
helping you actively learn many of the skills introduced in this course. The
best way to learn is through trial and error - there is sure to be a lot of both
during your project. We would like to help you define a project that is within
the scope of the course and the semester time limit on the work. A good project
will have several characteristics:

* Uses multiple disciplines we discuss (i.e. mechanical, electrical, software, etc.)
* Solves a problem with no commercial solution or no economical commercial solution.
* Will not cost thousands of dollars to build. Plan on $50-$100.
* Does not put you or others in the path of potential harm or danger.

Brainstorm 5 potential project ideas. Think about the problem and potential ways
to approach it. Sketching ideas may help your brainstorming. Turn your project
ideas in on paper or via email. Setup a meeting with the instructors to discuss
your ideas.
