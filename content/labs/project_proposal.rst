After you have discussed your potential project ideas from the :ref:`project_brainstorm`
activity with the instructors, it is time to nail down exactly what your project
will be and what the deliverables will be. Write a summary of one page or less
that describes:

* What your project is.
* What it will do.
* What resources you will need to complete it.
* What parts you may need and a rough estimate of the cost.

This will serve as the specification document for your project goals at the end
of the term.

Example
-------
To help aid your writing, we've created a sample project proposal. Your
proposal does not need to have this exact structure, but we have created it
to clearly show what needs to be addressed in your document.
