After you have discussed your potential project ideas from the :ref:`project_brainstorm`
activity with the instructors, it is time to nail down exactly what your project
will be and what the deliverables will be. Write a summary of one page or less
that describes what your project is, what it will do, and what resources you
will need to complete it. This will serve as the specification document for your
project goals at the end of the term.
