Calibration
===========

In order to trust the measurements from our sensors and to get physical
quantities in meaningful units (rarely are volts meaningful), we need good
calibration data on the instrument. Ideally the response of the sensor is linear
across its designed measurement range or the response is easily characterized.
Minimal hysteresis effects are also desirable. In this activity you will perform
a calibration on a transducer. This is a real exercise that we must perform on
many transducers in the laboratory on an annual or semi-annual basis.

Tasks
-----

1. Hookup the transducer to the power supply and voltmeter as shown below or
   as advised by the instructor. In this lab we will be using a direct current
   displacement transducer (DCDT) for the transducer and a vertical height gage
   as the transfer standard. Setup the height gage and DCDT to perform the
   calibration. Make sure that all components are aligned to reduce any error
   during the calibration. Take a photo of your setup and include it in the lab
   report. (4 pts.)

 2. Measure the output of the power supply. In this case, the power supply
    should be set to +/- 15 V. What are the actual output values? (2 pts.)

    |

3. What are the maximum and minimum voltages you would expect to be able to
   measure as outputs from this transducer? (2 pts.)

   |

4. Move the transducer until you are at one end of the output range. Move the
   transducer core in 1 mm steps using the vertical height gage and record the
   output voltage at each step until you reach the other end of the output
   range. You could record the output continuously on a computer in the
   laboratory. In this case, at a random time, look up and write down the number
   displayed on the voltmeter at that instant. Repeat this three times and use
   the average value of those readings as the measurement at that displacement.
   Once you have reached the maximum range, do back down the range in the same
   1 mm steps repeating your measurements. This will help us understand if there
   are any hysteresis effects in the transducer. Present your raw and averaged
   data in a data table. (10 pts.)

|

5. Make a plot of displacement vs. output voltage for the transducer. Is the
   output of the transducer linear over the entire range? Are there any
   hysteresis effects observed in the data? If so, what could have caused them?
   (5 pts.)

   |

6. Fit a line to the linear portion of this data and explain the meaning of the
   slope and intercept of this line. What can we say about readings outside of
   the linear portion of the transducer's range? Would we use them as
   experimental observations? (5 pts.)

   |

7. Apply your calibration factor to the transducer sample data to provide
   a relative displacement time-series. The data file contains two columns of
   data separated by commas. The first column is relative time in seconds, the
   second is the output of the transducer in volts Assume the transducer starts
   at "0 mm" displacement and produce a plot of the displacement time series.
   (6 pts.)

8. What calibration biases could be introduced in our setup? (2 pts.)

9. What other factors could influence the output of the transducer that we are
   not considering in this calibration? (2 pts.)
