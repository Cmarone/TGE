In this activity you will learn how to calculate temperatures measured by a
thermistor in a simple resistive divider circuit. The data were collected at
around room temperature on a frictional shearing experiment. As the experiment
was sheared, some heat was generated. Calculate the time-series of the
temperature throughout the experiment. The data collection rate is one sample
per second.

Questions
---------
1. The thermistor part number B57861S103A39 was used in this experiment. Download the
   datasheet below and find the :math:`B_{25/100}` and :math:`R_{25}` values
   for this part. What are they? (2 pts.)

   |

2. Calculate the resistance of the thermistor for the time series data. Is the
   mean above or below the :math:`R_{25}` value? What does that tell you about
   the expected temperatures values? (4 pts.)

3. Calculate the temperature of the thermistor for the time series data. What
   are the maximum and minimum values? (4 pts.)

4. Make a plot of the time series of temperature. Assume that the data were
   collected at one sample per second. (2 pts.)
