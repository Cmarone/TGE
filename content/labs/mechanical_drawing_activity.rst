Mechanical Drawing Activity
===========================

Now that you know how to make a mechanical drawing that the machine shop can
read, it is time to practice. You will be provided (or need to find) a simple
part and reverse engineer it into a mechanical drawing for the shop. This is a
common practice when you need to make a copy of a part to replace a broken part
or to create a slightly modified design of some part on a piece of equipment.
Use the necessary measuring tools to create a fully dimensioned drawing of your
part, on a one-to-one scale if possible. Don't forget to use any necessary
center lines and to use good dimensioning style. Do not pick a difficult to draw
cast part unless you really want a challenge! Brackets and simple lab
jigs/fixtures are a good idea for your first try. See the examples below.
