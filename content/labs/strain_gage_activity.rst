Strain Gage Activity
====================

In this activity you will learn how to apply strain gages to an
object of your choice. It could be a rock, a ceramic mug, or anything else you
think would have an interesting strain signal when squeezed, bent, or twisted
by hand. We will build on this activity for several classes when learning how
to condition, amplify, and record signals from transducers.

Materials
---------
* Item to instrument (rock, metal plate, etc.)
* Strain gages (4x)
* Small gauge hookup wire
* Superglue
* Cellophane tape
* Acetone and cloth
* Square
* Marker
* Soldering iron/solder
* Tweezers

Procedure
---------
1. Clean the surface you'll use with acetone. It the surface is very smooth,
   roughen it first with some emery cloth to help adhesion.

2. We will be creating a full bridge circuit using four gages. Layout a square
   pattern on your test object that lets you place a gage on each side of the
   square. Mark the center of each side as well. The needs to be really square
   and relatively accurately measured distances - use good technique!

3. Place the strain gauge right side up on a clean surface. Get a short piece
   of cellophane tape and place it over the gage, taking care to **not** cover
   the solder pad area of the gages.

4. Using the superglue and tweezers, place one gage centered on each side of
   the square you just laid out. Place a **small amount** of glue beneath each
   gage. Any glue that gets onto the contacts will make soldering much more
   difficult later! Stick the gage in place with the tape. In an instrumentation
   for research setting, using the manufacturers gage bonding chemicals is
   recommended.

5. After all of the glue has dried, hookup the strain gages in a full bridge
   configuration -- pay attention the orientation of the gages when hooking
   them up or you could get no signal.

6. Hookup your bridge to a bi-polar power supply (two 9V batteries for example)
   and to a DMM set to read DC Voltage. The output under no-strain should be
   near zero volts. When you squeeze or deform your test object, you should
   observe a change in the output voltage. Be sure you are using the lowest
   range on the meter as this signal will likely be a few millivolts. We need to
   amplify the signal, but that is a future activity.

Deliverables
------------
Show us your strain gaged object and the output voltage change when you stress
your object.
