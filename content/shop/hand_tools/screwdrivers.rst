Screwdrivers are used to increase the torque you can apply to a screw by
providing a large diameter and textured grip rigidly connected to a hardened
shank with a driver ground into the end.

Types of Screwdrivers
---------------------
Screwdrivers are available in a variety of shapes to allow access to screws in
almost any possible orientation with many different clearances. Some screws may
be buried deep in a recessed hole, requiring a long shank, while others may have
almost no vertical clearance and require an offset screwdriver.

* **Normal** - The normal screwdriver has a shank whose length is roughly
  proportional to the size of the driver. These are the most commonly used
  screwdriver and should be the first thing you reach for.
* **Stubby** - For screws that have less vertical clearance, such as those in
  recessed cavities or inside enclosures, a stubby screwdriver is often used.
  These short shanked tools often have large handles and are likely the second
  most common form factor.
* **Offset** - In some cases, screws have almost no vertical clearance. An offset
  screwdriver has a right angle bend and can be used to access such screws.
* **Ratcheting** - To increase how fast the user can turn the screw, some
  screwdrivers are equipped with a ratcheting mechanism. These are very useful,
  but should not be used for high-torque screws and they ratchet mechanism can
  become stripped.

Types of Drives
---------------
There are many types of drives, so many that it is really impossible to cover
and not worth covering as you will commonly only encounter a few drives. Many
drive types have been introduced by manufacturers to prevent tampering, others
are used in certain niche applications only. A relatively comprehensive list of
screw drives is available in a `Wikipedia article <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_screw_drives>`_.

* **Slot** - The first drive developed. It has been traditionally the most common
  because of its low cost of manufacture. Slotted screws are not common on
  anything that a power tool will be used on, as the blade slips out of the slot
  very easily. This could be dangerous to the part's finish and any nearby skin.
  You may hear this drive referred to as the common blade, standard, flat-blade,
  or flat-head drive.
* **Phillips** - This screw drive was dismissed by manufacturers in the 1930's, but
  has since become a very common drive. The cruciform nature of the phillips
  makes registering the driver into the screw easy and the blade cannot slip off
  the end of the head like common head screws. The Phillips does have a tendency
  to "cam out" at high torques. The bit will force itself up and out of the
  slots, possibly stripping. Other drives such as the PoziDriv were developed to
  combat this, but the Phillips is still commonly found in many applications. It
  is easy to confuse the Phillips with the very similar Fearson drive. Phillips
  drives have a blunt tip opposed to the sharp tip of the Fearson drive.
* **External** - External drives reverse the roles of the driver and screw head. The
  driver slips over a protruding pattern on the screw head, often square or hex.
  These provide a lower vertical clearance, but are much easier to tighten to
  high torques than common or Phillips drive screws.
* **Torx** - Torx is a trademarked name for a 6-point star shaped drive, generically
  referred to as the ISO10064 hexalobular internal drive. Torx provides a very
  good mechanical connection and can work in low vertical clearance situations.
* **Hex Socket (Allen)** - Similar to the external hex drive, the hex socket drive,
  commonly referred to as the Allen drive consists of a hexagonal pocket into
  the screw head and a hex shaped driver that fits into the "socket" head. This
  type of drive proves excellent mechanical connection and is often used in
  scientific equipment assembly.

Use
---
To use a screwdriver, first double check that you have the appropriate sized
driver for the fastener you need to remove or install. Using the wrong sized
tool will likely damage the fastener and make it difficult or impossible to
remove. Insert the driver into the fastener and press straight down firmly.
Turn the screwdriver clockwise to tighten or counter-clockwise to loosen a
regular right-handed thread fastener. Occasionally you will encounter left-handed
threads that are the opposite to this. As a rule of thumb, remember "righty
tighty, lefty loosey."

Screwdrivers are often used as pry bars, scrapers, or chisels, but they were
**NOT** designed for these tasks. Improper use will damage the tip, bend the
shank, and likely end in injury. A damaged screwdriver will then likely strip
the screw it is used on next and create a cascading event of damaged hardware.
Never use a chipped, bent, or otherwise mangled screwdriver.

Safety Precautions
------------------
The main safety hazards associated with screwdrivers are puncture wounds when
the tool slips out of the screw head. Improper use of the driver, as a pry bar
for example, could result in fracture and flying metal chips.
