Micrometers
===========
The micrometer is a precision measuring instrument with one fixed and one
movable face. The movable face uses a screw mechanism that allows very accurate
measurement of the distance between the faces. Variations of the micrometer
measure inside, outside, and depth of a part feature. In addition to the dial
caliper, the micrometer is a must for every laboratory toolkit. For very precise
measurements, care should be taken to not allow body heat to expand the
micrometer frame. The zero error of a micrometer should always be checked before
any measurement is commenced, as dirt on the faces is enough to throw off the
reading.
