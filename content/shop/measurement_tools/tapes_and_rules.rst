Tapes and Rules
===============
Constructing laboratory equipment requires the use of accurate measurement tools
to produce parts with tight tolerances. In this section of the course we will
cover some of the basic measurement tools used in the laboratory and show you
how to read them accurately.

Tape Measure
------------
The tape measure is used for rough measuring, cutting of stock, and often wooden
and metal frame construction. It is a spring steel material that is rolled into
a ruggedized carrier. The tape measure can be extended, locked, and used to
measure easily down to the 16th of an inch. Tape measures have a few special
features that allow easy measurement in a variety of construction scenarios. See
video below for a few tips and tricks that you probably didn't know you could do
with a tape measure.

Folding Rule
------------
The folding rule is a predecessor to the tape measure, and often has about the
same accuracy. Its advantage is that it is a rigid device, so it can be used in
the situations where the measurement device needs to extend a significant length
without bending, warping, or breaking over as tape measures are known to do.

Steel Rule
----------
The steel rule is one of the most common measurement devices the laboratory and
is easily read to a fraction of an inch. Its rigid construction with fine
engraved measurement fiducials makes it a pocket essential when working in the
machine shop or laboratory.
