Indicators
=============
Indicators are used to very precisely align parts for machining and test
operations. Their operation is often similar to dial indicators.

Test Indicator
--------------
The test indicator measures smaller deflections than the dial gauge. Instead of
a pin retracting into the mechanism, the deflection of an arm is measured. These
are often used when aligning milling machine heads or otherwise indicating
pieces for machining operations.

Haimer Indicator
----------------
Haimer gauges are used in CNC machining operations to find the edges of a part
in all three dimensions. These zero points are used by the software to locate
the stock in the machine's workspace before the machining operation can begin.

Edge Finder
-----------
Edge finders are used on the mill to locate the edge of the part and align it
with the spindle. Often edge finders are operated by sight or feel, but provide
remarkably accurate and reproducible edge locations.
