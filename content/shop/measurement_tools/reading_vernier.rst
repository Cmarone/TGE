Reading Vernier Scales
======================
The Vernier scale was invented in 1631 by a French mathematician. It is a
secondary set of graduations on a measurement tool at a fixed fractional spacing
of the main scale that allow a much more accurate reading of the instrument.
Reading a Vernier scale takes some practice, but can be done very accurately.
The Vernier is common in laboratory equipment and large machinists measuring
tools, so being able to read it is an important skill for the experimentalist.
