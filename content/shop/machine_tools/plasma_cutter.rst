Plasma Cutters
==============

Plasma cutters use an electric current to create an accelerated jet of hot
plasma. This heats and melts the metal, with a jet of air blowing away the
molten metal. A plasma gas (often an Argon mix) is also consumed during the
cutting operation. Plasma cutters produce a very clean cut and are very easy
to use. CNC models are available that can cut very complex designs from
large sheets of metal in minutes.

The plasma cutter is almost a "point-and-shoot" activity, but there are a few
things to know before you use one. The video below does a good job of showing
how to perform a basic cut.

Safety Precautions
------------------
The main safety hazards are flying hot metal and UV exposure. Protective dark
eyewear, gloves, and clothing should be worn. Be careful to now allow the cut
parts to fall on your feet when cutting.
