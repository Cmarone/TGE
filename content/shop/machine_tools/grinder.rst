Grinders
========

Grinders are used to abrade away material with abrasive disks and brushes. The
most common forms are the bench and angle grinders. For grinding surfaces to
be very precise and smooth, there are also surface and cylindrical grinders
that have grinding wheels held in precision stages and the part is moved via
an automatic feed mechanism.

Use
---
Grinder use is very easy, just be sure your hands cannot slip into the wheel
in any way. Take care to keep the part cool and not use excessive pressure.

Safety Precautions
------------------
Protective eyewear, hearing, respiratory protection, and clothing should be
worn. The grinder produces high temperature, high speed, flying bits of metal
that you do not want in your eyes, lungs, or skin. **Never** stand in front of
the grinding wheel, but off to the side. Grinding wheels are very brittle and
will at some point fail, especially if there is a small defect due to an impact.
The exploding wheel will hurl high velocity chunks that can easily penetrate the
body.
