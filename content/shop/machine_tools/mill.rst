Mill
====

The milling machine brings a rotating cutter into contact with a stationary and
clamped workpiece that is help on a precision table. Milling can produce very
flat and high precision parts with contours, holes, grooves, and other complex
features. CNC milling machines have made it possible to turn a solid block of
material into a complex shape in a matter of minutes to hours.

Milling machines are generally found in the vertical and horizontal types,
referring to the axis of rotation of the tool. The vertical mill is most
commonly found in shops, but well equipped shops have both types. Horizontal
mills can be setup with ganged cutters to reduce the number of operations that
must be performed on a piece during production.

The mill, in principle, is very basic to use, but learning how to accurately
operate the machine and its accessories takes some time and practice. The videos
below are a good starter series to help you learn the basic operations.

Safety Precautions
------------------
The biggest safety hazard is being cut or entangled by the rotating tool. Hair,
clothing, and anything else hanging from the body present hazards. Also, never
try to clean chips away with your hand. Proper eye protection should also be
worn.
